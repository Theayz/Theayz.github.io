<p><a id="page-148"></a>Showers of sparks fly, red beams of light flash.</p>
<p>Flakes of burned metal are launched from the horn with every blow. And yet they all just flow harmlessly off of Mr. Welf’s black coat and to the floor. I wonder if it has some of the same qualities as adventurer’s armor…</p>
<p>Wait, that’s it.</p>
<p>His black coat is in such rough shape because it’s his work clothes.</p>
<p>Its black color and worn condition are all proof of how hard he’s worked, how many pieces he’s made.</p>
<p>“I absolutely despise magic swords. That kind of power rots people’s souls. The user, the smith’s pride—anyone and everyone. At the very least, Crozzo’s Magic Swords do.”</p>
<p>The all-powerful magic swords that corrupted their creators.</p>
<p>“Cursed magic swordsmiths.”</p>
<p>I think I finally understand what those words mean.</p>
<p>“I won’t make a magic sword. And even if I did, I’d never put it up for sale.”</p>
<p>Sweat dripping down to his chin, Mr. Welf raises the hammer again.</p>
<p>Another round of echoes rings out. The workshop is drowned out in a fierce melody of impacts.</p>
<p>I’ve been so wrapped up in the spectacle that I forgot to wipe the sweat from my face.</p>
<p>The metallic smell that hit me when I first walked in.</p>
<p>It was so strong that I wanted to cover my nose. But now it seems so far away.</p>
<p>I continue to watch Mr. Welf strike the horn over and over again.</p>
<p class="orn"><img src="../Images/image00155.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="space-break">I take a look outside the shutters and see an evening sky. It’s almost nighttime.</p>
<p>At last, Mr. Welf is almost finished.</p>
<p>“…That should do it.”</p>
<p>“Whoa…!”</p>
<p><a id="page-149"></a>Mr. Welf emerges from the corner of the workshop carrying a shallow box in his hands. He places it on his workbench.</p>
<p>I lean over the bench to get a good look and see a dark red blade inside.</p>
<p>The cutting edge of the blade is so thin I can almost see through it. It’s just a little bit shorter than the Divine Knife. The blade color matches the Minotaur Horn almost perfectly.</p>
<p>The hilt is a reddish maroon color and is probably shaped to fit my hand.</p>
<p>“T-this…this is…really, really good…!”</p>
<p>“I had good material. Out of all my work so far, this has gotta be my best.”</p>
<p>Mr. Welf smiles from ear to ear with the satisfaction of a job well done.</p>
<p>He’s being modest, but I can tell by the look in his eye he’s very proud of this one. He wouldn’t use the word “best” if he wasn’t.</p>
<p>I bow my head over and over to show my gratitude.</p>
<p>“Ah—sorry. Didn’t have time to make a sheath. I’ll have a custom one ready by tomorrow, so can you put up with a generic one for tonight?”</p>
<p>“S-sure, of course! Actually, it doesn’t have to be tomorrow…It’s already late.”</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s better to finish everything when it’s still warm.</p>
<p>“That’s how metal is,” he says while rotating his right shoulder.</p>
<p><em>That’s just what a smith would say. Hang on, he actually</em> is <em>a smith.</em> I grimace at my own train of thought.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if all smiths are people like Mr. Welf.</em> Images of their daily life pass through my head as I space out for a moment.</p>
<p>“Now, this guy needs a name.”</p>
<p>He leans over in front of me and takes a long, hard look at the dark red blade.</p>
<p>His eyes narrow as he scratches his chin with his right hand.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen someone focus so hard on something before…He slowly opens his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“The Young Bull, Ushiwakamaru……No, the Bull Dagger, Minotan.”</p>
<p><a id="page-150"></a>“Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, WAIT! Isn’t the first one so much better?!”</p>
<p>“Huh? You like Ushiwakamaru better, Bell?”</p>
<p>“I don’t even have to think about it!”</p>
<p>I speak so vigorously that spit flies out of my mouth and toward Mr. Welf.</p>
<p>I do my best to convince him to go with the first name. “Okay then…” he says with a very sad look in his eyes, but he accepts it.</p>
<p>“All right, take it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much, Mr. Welf!”</p>
<p>I grab a sheath from his weapon shelf as he holds the dagger out to me.</p>
<p>I say one more thank-you and reach out to take it from him…<em>Woosh!</em> Suddenly the blade is pointed right at my chest!</p>
<p>“Ehhh?” My jaw slacks in surprise.</p>
<p>“That’s it.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what’s it?”</p>
<p>“That’s the last time you call me that uptight name.”</p>
<p>His words just add to my dumbfounded shock as my eyes peel back.</p>
<p>“We haven’t known each other for long, and I can’t say we completely trust each other, either, but call me something like I call Li’l E.</p>
<p>“Something like friends,” adds Mr. Welf—no, Welf—with a grin.</p>
<p>A smile floats to my lips as I respond.</p>
<p>“Gotcha, Welf.”</p>
<p>He flips the hilt of the blade forward and I grab hold.</p>
